         <h2 id="nameOfRecipe">Bacon Wrapped Jalapeno Poppers</h2>
         <img src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/newscms/2019_36/1478751/food-today-main5-190905.jpg" alt="Jalapeno Poppers" width="500" height="300">
         <p>Jalapeno poppers are the perfect balance of sweet, savory, and spicy! First, hollow the jalapenos. Next, add a cream cheese spread. (Pineapple cream cheese is the best!) And finally, wrap the cream cheese stuffed peppers in thick cut bacon. We use a popper rack to keep the peppers upright in the grill. DON'T FORGET! Use a tray under your peppers to catch grease, we don't want to start a fire! You'll grill them on low (or 350 degrees F) for 30 min to an hour depending on how crispy you like your bacon.</p>

            <h2 id="nameOfRecipe">Chicken Dumpling Soup</h2>

            <p>Get a big pot. Chop the trinity: carrots, onions, and celery. Add to pot with butter and salt and pepper. Saute. Once the flavors have spent some time together, add ya broth. Turn heat up to a bubububububoil, then reduce to simmer. Get chimken. You can cook the chicken in your broth or add pre-cooked chicken. Once chicken is cooked, add your dumps. My preferance is Reames brand dumplings in the frozen isle of your local grocery store. Follow the cooking instructions of the dumps. Once dumps are cooked, season to taste. I like to add Lawry's garlic salt and some ceyenne peppa for a little kick.</p>

            <h2 id="nameOfRecipe">Thai Inspired Cucumber Salad</h2>
            <img src="https://www.dinneratthezoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/asian-cucumber-salad-1.jpg" alt="Thai Inspired Cucumber Salad" width="300" height="400">
            <p>Get a salad bowl. Get them cucumbers cut into whichever shape you prefer. I suggest cutting them to halves lengthwise and scoopin out the seeds and then choping them into 'C' shapes. Mince up some garlic and ginger, rough chop on some gosh dang jalapenos and cilantro. Cut some red onion into thin long pieces, is it called julien cut? I do not know. WAIT. DON'T ADD IT TO THE BOWL YET. We need to make our dressing. I eyeball everything so good luck. I use fish sauce, apple cider vinegar, stevia sweetener, lime juice, salt, and pepper. MIX IT. Add all that stuff you were slicing and chopping up. Mix some more. Get some dern peanuts, crush em a bit, dust your salad with that crushed peanut. Do not add crushed peanuts to the main bowl, please only add them as you portion your servings because belive it or not peanuts get soft and weird in the sauce. </p>
